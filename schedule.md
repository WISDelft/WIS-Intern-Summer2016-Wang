### Schedule

#### Week1

Submit an overview (several-page slides) on current pre-trained models using deep learning for:

- Text (especially short text):
    + tagging
    + classification
    + sentiment analysis
- Multimedia (image):
    + tagging
    + classification
    + description
    + sentiment analysis

in a social media/urban computing context.

#### Week2

Literature review on domain of Urban Analytics and Neural Networds, start to write a survey towards this domain (personal understanding and potentioal research direction).

#### Week3

1. Do more literature review on Urban Computing (in a social network context).
2. Contact with Jie to formalize most important papers to read.
3. Focus on one pre-trained model on Caffee and implement it.
4. Write a document to identify different intent/usecase for current deep learning model.
